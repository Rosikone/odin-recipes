        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour 200g</li>
            <li>Water 100ml</li>
            <li>Brewer's yeast 4g</li>
            <li>Salt 10g</li>
            <li>Tomato souce 300g</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese 200g</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the flour on a bowl</li>
            <li>Crumble the yeast inside</li>
            <li>Pour the water little by little, The right temperature of the water is 25 degrees</li>
            <li>When you have added almost all the water, add the salt</li>
            <li>Continue to add the water, starting to knead with your hands, to mix the ingredients</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to the work surface and work it with your hands until it is smooth and homogeneous</li>
            <li>At this point, let it rest on the work surface for about ten minutes, covering it with the bowl After the leavening time, the dough will be nice and swollen</li>
            <li>Once rested, give it a small fold: imagine that the sphere is divided into 4 parts, take the end of each one, pull it gently and fold it towards the center</li>
            <li>Once the 4 folds have been made, turn it over on itself</li>
            <li>give it the shape of a sphere</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough thus formed into a bowl, cover with transparent film</li>
            <li>And let rise. For convenience you can put the bowl in the oven off but with the light on, so the inside will reach a temperature of 26-28°, ideal for leavening; alternatively you can also keep the basin in a warm place. Times are approximate since each dough, temperature and weather conditions affect leavening: on average, the dough should take 6 hours to double in volume.</li>
            <li>hen transfer it to the work surface and divide it with a tarot into 3 pieces of 265 g</li>
            <li>If you need it, you can lightly flour your work surface. Now take each portion and as before, lift a flap of dough and bring it inwards. Repeat the same operation for the other 3 flaps of dough</li>
            <li>Turn the dough upside down and proceed with rolling it: rolling the dough means turning it with your hands on the work surface, bringing it towards you and then repeatedly moving it away until you get a smooth and regular ball</li>
            <li>Gradually transfer the loaves into a previously greased pizza box and cover whit its lead</li>
            <li>Let them rest for another 30 minutes</li>
            <li>In the meantime, place the refractory stone in the oven, place it on the top. Turn on the oven bringing the temperature to 250° and activating the static mode. Now using a tarot gently lift the first loaf</li>
            <li>Transfer it to a surface with plenty of semolina and add a little more semolina to the surface. Press the dough in the center with your fingertips</li>
            <li>Continue in this way making a rotating movement in order to widen the dough</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to the paddle, taking care not to damage it</li>
            <li>Now, using a spoon, spread the tomato souce on the pizza, leaving a free edge</li>
            <li>Place in the oven, sliding the pizza gently onto the refractory stone and cook for about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the mozzarella into sticks</li>
            <li>After 6 minutes, always using the shovel, take the pizza out of the oven</li>
            <li>Arrange the mozzarella sticks on top</li>
            <li>Put it in the oven for another 6 minutes. When it is golden brown, take it out of the oven, add the basil leaves</li>
            <p>Et voila now you have a delicious pizza to enjoi</p>
